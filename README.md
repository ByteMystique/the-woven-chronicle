# The Woven Chronicle

An **endless, community-written, AI-modified story** that streams forever.  
Visitors toss in threads; the AI weaves them into the narrative—no endings, only vibes.

> Built for fun, FOSS, and glorious uselessness.

**Stack (free):**  
- Frontend: Vite + Vanilla JS (host on Vercel)  
- DB/Realtime: Supabase (free tier)  
- AI: WebLLM in the browser (Phi-3 mini) — no API keys, no server bills

Jump to the full setup later (committed in a later docs update).
