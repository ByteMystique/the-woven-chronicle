# The Woven Chronicle üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ByteMystique


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Jayadev Narayanan - School of Engineering, CUSAT

### Project Description
A chaotic, collaborative storytelling web app where anyone can add a sentence, twist the plot, and watch an AI weave it together in real time. Think Wikipedia meets improv theatre‚Ä¶ on a bus at night.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Stories make too much sense and end too neatly. Where‚Äôs the chaos?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Let strangers + a tiny on-device AI take turns deciding what happens next. No rules, no take-backs, no plot armour.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- None (vanilla; built with Vite)

- Supabase (Postgres + Realtime), Vercel (hosting)
- **LLM:** Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC (running in-browser via WebGPU)

For Hardware:
- A computer or phone  
- Internet connection  
- An iron will to endure chaotic plotlines
