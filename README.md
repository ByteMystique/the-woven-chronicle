# The Woven Chronicle üå™Ô∏è

## Basic Details

### Team Name: WeaveMasters

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Jayadev Narayanan ‚Äì School of Engineering, CUSAT


### Project Description
A chaotic, collaborative storytelling web app where *anyone* can add a sentence, twist the plot, and watch an AI weave it all together in real time.  
Think Wikipedia meets improv theatre‚Ä¶ but on a bus at night.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have too much control over the stories they read. They can predict endings, follow plots, and know what‚Äôs coming next. That‚Äôs boring.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Let random strangers + an AI chaos machine take turns deciding what happens next. No rules, no take-backs, no plot armour. It‚Äôs a literary trainwreck ‚Äî and we love it.
