# The Woven Chronicle üå™Ô∏è

## Basic Details

### Team Name: ByteMystique

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Jayadev Narayanan ‚Äì School of Engineering, CUSAT

### Project Description
A chaotic, collaborative storytelling web app where anyone can add a sentence, twist the plot, and watch an AI weave it together in real time. Think Wikipedia meets improv theatre‚Ä¶ on a bus at night.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Stories make too much sense and end too neatly. Where‚Äôs the chaos?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Let strangers + a tiny on-device AI take turns deciding what happens next. No rules, no take-backs, no plot armour.
